- 👋 Hi, I’m Fathi M Salem @nAIsystems
- 👀 I’m interested in Neural AI Systems (nAIsystems) which include Recurrent Neural Networks and Architectures. I have recently published a (Text-)book
entitled "Recurrent Neural Networks: from simple to gated architectures," Springer, January 2022. I hope to create a repository here for the 
the supplementarty material (syllabus, tutorials, notes,...) associated with the textbook.
- 🌱 I’m currently investigating Robust feedback/recurrent Neural Networks as unbounded storage associative memories
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on unbounded capacity feedback/recurrent neural networks.
- 📫 You can reach me via salemf@msu.edu or fathimsalem@gmail.com
